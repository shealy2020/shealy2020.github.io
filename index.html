<p>The metaphors we use to understand our own interactions with AI change as quickly as we come up with them: from AI as digital intern to co-collaborator to document creator.</p>
<img class="wrap-text-right" src="images\words-desktop.svg" alt="Image with the words read, learn, listen, write, share, repeat">
<p>In practical terms, I want to cut through the noise to better understand the intersections of technical communication and AI (TCxAI) as they exist today and gain a clearer idea of what the field of technical communication can expect in the years ahead.</p>
<p>I'm Sean Healy. I've worked in the software industry for over 15 years, mostly within documentation teams, where I wrangled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DITA</a> as a technical writer, content strategist, and software developer/architect.</p>
<p>I want to create processes and build toolchains that actually aid in productivity for documentation teams without a lot of overhead. I started this blog because I wasn't finding enough <em>actionable</em> information on the web but for notable exceptions listed in the <em><a href="/resources/#ai-web-resources">Resources</a></em> page. (Admittedly, I have a bias for recent web resources over books as I suspect the latter begin to sprout mushrooms within a year of their initial publish date.) I realize AI is a fast-moving target and difficult to pin down with any specificity, but much of information I find on the subject is conjecture, vague, or some form of company-sponsored clickbait.</p>
<p>These <a href="/posts">posts</a> chronicle my exploration into the Wild West of AI. They are more travel logs than tutorials, but if you can take something from them, you are welcome to it. I'll push prototypes and other artifacts to <a href="https://github.com/shealy2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, so you'll have jumping-off points for your own AI travels.</p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact</a> me if you'd like more details about any of these posts or if you have come across good TCxAI resources.</p>
